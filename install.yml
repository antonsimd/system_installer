# This install.yml task list is included from the system_repos_packages role in

# TODO: In v2.9.13 apt_key doesn't support proxies defined in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d
# Not an issue in this file since it is used on management nodes which
# are not using proxies (in production) or using them system wide
# in /etc/environment
